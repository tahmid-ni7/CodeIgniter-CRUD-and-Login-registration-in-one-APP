## Note:
 ***"ci_db"*** sql file inside "tool" folder. After clone or downloading this project you should named the main folder as ***"ci-login"*** because I set the base_url as "ci-login". If you want to set your custom projrct name you should change the base_url from config.php file and .htaccess file also.
